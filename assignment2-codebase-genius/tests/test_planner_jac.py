# Test for Jac walker plan_documentation_targets
# Since Jac walkers are tested via integration (e.g., jac run), not unit tests.
# To test: Run jac run jac/supervisor.jac with mocked byllm (if Jac supports injection).
# For now, this file serves as a placeholder.
# Expected behavior: LLM returns JSON array of relative paths; walker validates and returns absolute paths to existing files.
# Fallback: validated entry_points.

# No code here; integration testing recommended.
